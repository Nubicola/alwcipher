# EQ Concordance

# Purpose

This application supports you in building a corpus of English words, grouped by their EQ (ALW) cipher value. Type in a word or phrase: the EQ value is shown, as well as all other words that have the same value already in your corpus. Type in a number (in the "nubmers" tab) and you'll see all the items that match the number.

EQ is a way of discovering relationships between words and phrases. You can learn a lot more on (Wikipedia - English Qaballa)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Qaballa]

# Roadmap
- release for Mac and maybe even mobile app
- export corpus to text by alphabetically
- add page to load a text file and annotate every word with its value

- better error info
