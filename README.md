Roadmap
- Corpus: SaveTo, LoadFrom. 
- UI:
    - Make SaveTo and LoadFrom visible in interface
    - New tab: numeric corpus explorer
        - Type in a number and it shows
            - N
            - N - 36 (removing the ego from the equation; what the I experiences)
            - Neo-pythagorean-reduction to 21, 9
    - New tab: file import to corpus (different from "loading!")
