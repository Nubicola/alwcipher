Bug: type a number into words tab shows wrong output

Roadmap
- Numbers tab could show it all as a tree or a string list. However, I had too many problems with the tree. For now, it's just a widget.
- No real error checking on import and such. Perhaps move import to a menu?
- UI:
    - New tab: numeric corpus explorer
        - Type in a number and it shows
            - N
            - N - 36 (removing the ego from the equation; what the I experiences)
            - Neo-pythagorean-reduction to 21, 9
    - New tab: file import to corpus (different from "loading!")
- clean up the help info
- better error info
