Known bug
Load a corpus, press calculate with no string - crash
Numbers tab doesn't scroll right. Set wrapping on the elements themselves?
Importing leaves numbers in there (like 46)

How to expose any data about the corpus (maybe for debug purposes?)

Roadmap
- when number tree is focused, typing numbers will filter the tree
- UI:
    - New tab: numeric corpus explorer
        - Type in a number and it shows
            - N
            - N - 36 (removing the ego from the equation; what the I experiences)
            - Neo-pythagorean-reduction to 21, 9
    - New tab: file import to corpus (different from "loading!")
- clean up the help info
- better error info
