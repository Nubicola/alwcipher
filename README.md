Roadmap
- Corpus: SaveTo, LoadFrom. How to deal with that in the most cross-platformy way? Requires numerous files is the problem...?
Corpus doesn't expose its underlying datatype. Visitor pattern exposure would do the trick. VisitAllVaues(func v)
- UI:
    - New tab: numeric corpus explorer
    - New tab: file import to corpus (different from "loading!")
