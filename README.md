# EQ Concordance

# Purpose

This application supports you in building a corpus of English words, grouped by their EQ (ALW) cipher value. Type in a word or phrase: the EQ value is shown, as well as all other words that have the same value already in your corpus. Type in a number (in the "nubmers" tab) and you'll see all the items that match the number.

EQ is a way of discovering relationships between words and phrases. You can learn a lot more on (Wikipedia - English Qaballa)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Qaballa]

# Roadmap
- release for Mac and maybe even mobile app
- export corpus to text by alphabetically
- add page to load a text file and annotate every word with its value
- number list -- scroll w/ up, down

- Numbers tab could show it all as a tree or a string list. However, I had too many problems with the tree. For now, it's just a widget.
- better error info
- verse, phrase, word export option:  verse seperated by blank lines, phrases seperated by any punctuation marks, words by any white space. 
maybe with headings for words Numerically, phrases Numerically, verses Numerically
